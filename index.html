    <h2><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
    <p>I'm 32 years old, I'm a Brazilian woman that is doing a program on Algonquin College called 
      Interactive Media Design; I chose to doing this program because all the courses are about 
      something that I love; Besides I love all the courses, my favorites are  photography, digital 
      graphic, and web development.</p>
    <p>I have an alternative style that combine cute with punk style. My favorite things to do 
      when I have free time are, seeing TikTok videos, watching animes, doing some easy sport, 
      watching some tv show, and watching YouTube videos. My favorite pet is cat and gecko, 
      and I have <em>obsession</em> for some objects, and shapes.</p>
