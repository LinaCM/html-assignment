    <h2><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
    <p>I'm 32 years old, I'm a Brazilian woman that is doing a program on Algonquin College called 
      Interactive Media Design; I chose to doing this program because all the courses are about 
      something that I love; Besides I love all the courses, my favorites are  photography, digital 
      graphic, and web development.</p>
    <p>I have an alternative style that combine cute with punk style. My favorite things to do when 
      I have free time are:
      <ul> 
        <li>seeing TikTok videos</li>
        <li>watching animes</li> 
        <li>doing some easy sport</li> 
        <li>watching some tv show
        <li>watching YouTube videos</li>
        </ul> 
        My favorite pet is cat and gecko, and I have <em>obsession</em> for 
      some objects, and shapes.</p>
